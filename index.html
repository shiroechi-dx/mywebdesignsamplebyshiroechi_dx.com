Other readers may be young (they may be children who do not have much knowledge of English) or have learning difficulties. The language is simple, but the ideas don't have to be. If you find anything wrong, please correct it.</p><p>Simple English Wikipedia follows some of the rules of Basic English, but is not so strict about using only a certain number of words. Every day, Simple English changes, and does not have only one-word list. A good starting point to writing in Simple English is to learn to write using Basic English words. This helps you to write with a limited vocabulary.</p>
